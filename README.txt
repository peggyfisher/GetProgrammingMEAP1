README
Each of the code snippets in the Get Programming with Java texbook
have been included here in this Git Repo. 

Since every IDE has different requirements for the file and folder 
structure, the code included in these files must be copied and pasted into your class files with the appropriate naming structure. 

Remember, in Java, the class name MUST match the file name or you will get a compile time error. 

Some code files are only partial code snippets, so make sure you fill in the missing components if needed.
